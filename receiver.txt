What is Android Broadcast Receiver?
A broadcast receiver is a dormant component of the Android system. 
Only an Intent (for which it is registered) can bring it into action. 
The Broadcast Receiverâ€™s job is to pass a notification to the user, 
in case a specific event occurs.

Using a Broadcast Receiver, 
applications can register for a particular event.
 Once the event occurs, the system will notify all the registered applications.
 a Broadcast receiver triggers battery Low notification that you see on your mobile screen.

Other instances caused by a Broadcast Receiver are new friend notifications, new friend feeds,
 new message etc. on your Facebook app.

In fact, you see broadcast receivers at work all the time.
 Notifications like incoming messages, WiFi Activated/Deactivated message etc. 
are all real-time announcements of what is happening in the Android system and the applications.
